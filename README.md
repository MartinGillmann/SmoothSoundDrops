# SmoothSoundDrops

## This is a hands on project to play around with React.

It displays music notes so that I can play it on the piano.

## Still to come:
- Remove hardcoded notes and geather them from the server
- Make the Docker deployment to host it on my Raspberry Pi
- Make it look nice by adding css
